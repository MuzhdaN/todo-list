        that calls deleteTodo with todo.id as an argument. Itâ€™s a function expression 
        that gets executed only when the onClick event occurs. This is the correct way 
        to pass an argument to an event handler in React.
        onClick={deleteTodo(todo.id)}: This is a function call that executes
        deleteTodo immediately during the rendering phase, not as a response 
        to the onClick event. It will call deleteTodo as soon as the component renders, 
        which is not the intended behavior for an onClick event handler.
